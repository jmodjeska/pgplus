# get_dir 1.0 (17.06.98)
# Written by Richard Lawrence (aka Silver)
#
# This script works out the ROOT macro for the talker and sets it up in
# the header file 'include/root.h'. It is a hell of a lot more
# compilicated than you think because the script should not modify the
# file if the paths are the same.
# (if it did, you'd be recompiling every single file every 'make')
#

#
# Get the path to the talker. We assume that this is being run from the
# Makefile in the src directory.
#

cd ..
root_dir=`pwd`
cd src

#
# Create the file and display some details in the makefile to assure
# the user
#

echo "Talker path detected as : $root_dir/"
echo " "
echo "#define ROOT \"$root_dir/\"" > include/root.temp

#
# Does the 'include/root.h' file exist? If not then we need to just move
# that file.
#

if [ ! -e "include/root.h" ]
then
  mv include/root.temp include/root.h
  exit
fi

#
# Is there any difference between this new one and the current one?
#

if [ -n "`diff include/root.temp include/root.h`" ]
then
  mv include/root.temp include/root.h
  exit
fi

#
# There is no difference so we can just leave 'include/root.h' untouched
#

rm -f include/root.temp
