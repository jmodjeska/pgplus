Title: mem_test
Version: 0.13
Entered-date: 07AP98
Description: mem_test is a library which is used to help locate memory leaks in a
             program under development.
             
             mem_test is certainly not the only such library in existence, but it
             is the one that I wrote for my own use, and I felt that others may
             find it to be of value.
Keywords: memory leaks malloc free
