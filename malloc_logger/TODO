- Add support for some functions that allocate memory which
  libmem_test does not now know about.

- Think about adding support of some sort for calls made to malloc and
  company made by other library functions, such as those used in xlib
  programming, which I'm just starting to learn in November 1997. I know
  that commercial, and I think some freeware memory debugging
  libraries, programs do this, so it is possible, but it might take
  a total re-think of the libmem_test philosophy. Or maybe I should just
  look into using other debugging libs for that sort of work. But
  libmem_test is my baby... :-)

- When I send MEM_TEST_FILE into stdin on mem_analyze, I get an uninit
  error

- when I send a GDSII stream file in, I get lots of errors. It should
  probably just print one error and quite. Naturally, this is a
  ludicrous thing to do, but it should be handled gracefully.

- mem_analyze should at least try to verify that the input lines are
  good. A good start would be to count the fields

- There's a minor bug n the Makefile, it tries to rm a no-existent
  file
