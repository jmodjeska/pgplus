0.13

- Discovered that 0.12 (and all earlier versions) would not compile
  under RedHat 5.0. Fixed it. Thanks to those who reported it.

- Fixed the error in the LSM entry that pointed to 0.11

0.12

- Stopped complaints about 'Value of <HANDLE> construct can be "0"'
  produced by mem_analyze

0.11

A minor bug fix and robustness release.

- Fixed the bug in the Makefile that caused it to try to delete the
  non-existent file, libmemtest.a

- Fixed the bug in mem_analyze that caused it to emit an error about
  the use of an uninitialized variable warning when the data was passed
  to STDIN.

- Added some checking for the proper field count in input lines to
  mem_analyze.

- If a field count error in mem_analyze was overridden with -i (or,
  before the field count was checked), lines with an illegal field count
  triggered other uninitialized variable errors. Fixed.
